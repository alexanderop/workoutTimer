/**
 * Full app-state reset for browser-tier tests: database, persisted
 * preferences, and theme class. Use as `beforeEach(resetAppState)`.
 *
 * Atom-held state (notes list, toasts, quick-add sheet) needs no reset here:
 * renderApp provides a fresh atom registry per mount, so it never outlives a
 * test. What does leak between tests lives outside the registry —
 * IndexedDB, and the module-scoped VueUse refs behind useLocale and
 * useTheme. `localStorage.clear()` alone is not enough for those refs:
 * writes made in the same document fire no storage event, so the in-memory
 * values would survive into every later test in the file. Each composable
 * therefore exposes its own reset, and those are the source of truth here.
